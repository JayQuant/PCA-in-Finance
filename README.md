# PCA-in-Finance
This is a repository of codes exploring the application of PCA in Finance, specifically cryptos.

In this repository, we will be dealing with two main ideas:

1. [Basic analysis of eigenportfolios using R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JayQuant/PCA-Applied-to-Crypto/blob/main/MATH-3320---crypto-PCA.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JayQuant/PCA-in-Finance/blob/main/Eigenportfolios_Crypto.html))
2. Pairs Trading by constructing mean-reverting residuals

In 1., we provide a very basic peek into the concept of eigenportfolios, or eigenfactors, which are statistical factor constructed by applying PCA to the correlation matrix of the returns.

In 2., we will provide a comprehensive, in-depth analysis in dynamic eigenportfolios, constructing mean-reverting residuals by subtracting systematic factors from individual asset returns, and then constructing signals to trade these mean-reverting series. We will be closely replicating the paper written by Avellaneda (2008), but focusing on the practical side.
